Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans: 
Software engineering is simply the application of engineering principles in the design, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining of software, through the use of technologies. The sole aim of software engineering is to create software products that will automate tasks. The engineering of software is in phrases: Problem definition, this is involves the definition of the problem at hand. The problem the software product will address in this phase is well-detailed and documented. The next phase is the design: In the design phase, a design that illustrates what the software should do and how it will do it. This phrase is where the UI/UX personnel are involved. In the design phase, a prototype of the software product is designed showing the various steps/journeys. The next phase is the Building phase: In the building phase, the design is being coded, in this phase, various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT just to mention a few are applied. This is the phase where software developers work intensively on the design. The phrase involves the building of the frontend and backend of the software product. The frontend of the software products is the side of the software, that users interact with, while the backend is the side that involves the database and feeds the frontend with data. The next phase is the Testing: The testing phase is where the software product, passes through a series of tests. The essence of this test is to check for bugs(issues or problems) and if any fix them. The next phase is the deployment phrase. In this phase, the software product is now ready for use. The next phrase is the maintenance phase. In this phase, we maintain the software product, we can also add new features to the product. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Ans:
the three milestones in software engineering are:
a. The software crisis: During this period, software development was very complex, projects were over budget, the delivery of software products was late and behind schedule, and also full of bugs.
b. The rise of object-oriented programming (OOP): The introduction of OOP gave rise to a new way of thinking about software development. It focused on objects and interaction concepts. The OOP made software development scalable, reusable, modular, and easier to maintain code.
c. Agile Methodologies: This brought about a more flexible and adaptive approach to the development of software products. The agile methodologies, presses more on collaboration, iterative development, and customer satisfaction 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans:
The software development life cycle (SDLC): This is a well-detailed and comprehensive process used in the creation, testing, and development of software. 
The cycle is as follows:
a. Planning and Requirement analysis: This involves outlining, the goals, objectives, and scopes of the software project. In the phase of the SDLC, we identify the stakeholders (that is the various individuals involved in the project. The needs and expectations of the user are stated in clear terms.

b. Design: This involves designing the blueprint of the software product. In the design phase, software architecture, interface, and database are designed. We define the overall structure of the software and as such give a comprehensive detail of the various components and modules of the software.

c. Development (Coding): This phase is where we translate the design using various technologies. This phase is where the coding of the design comes into play. The actual creation of the software product is done here.

d. Testing: This phase is where we test the software product. The testing is very important because it helps in identifying errors and defects in the software product. We also test for quality, making sure the software meets the requirements. These tests are of different types such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

e. Deployment: This is where the software is made available for use by the users. It is the installation of the software on the user's machine and configuration.

f. Maintenance: This is the phase where we make changes to the software product after its deployment. Further addressing of bugs and errors that may arise are fixed and support is made available to users finding it difficult to use the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans:
The waterfall model is a linear and sequential process of design In the waterfall model, a phase must be completed before the next can begin. 
Agile model is a repetitive (iterative) approach to development. It is more flexible. The project is broken down into smaller cycles. 
The waterfall model is rigid and structured, it is most time difficult to change when compared to the Agile model which is flexible and easy to change. 
One major advantage of the waterfall model is that it is good for well-defined projects. One major advantage of the Agile model is that emphasizes customer collaboration, continuous testing, and integration, and is suitable for projects whose requirements are uncertain.
A good example of the waterfall model is the building of a bridge, where one phase must be completed before the other phase can start.
A good example of the agile model is developing an app that users need quickly. Note that the agile model allows for adjustments based on user feedback.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Ans:
A software developer is a person who is responsible for translating the design specification into a functional software product. These individuals are the backbone of the software project.
Their roles are: writing code, testing the code for functionality and efficiency, debugging, and collaborating with designers and quality assurance engineers.

A quality assurance engineer: These are individuals who ensure that the software product meets the quality standard set for it. They test the software to ensure that it meets the specific requirements.
Their roles are: developing test cases and plans; executing these test cases and reporting defects; automating the process of testing, and collaborating with the developer(s) to resolve issues.

A project manager oversees the software development process. These individuals are responsible for planning, organizing, and managing resources for the project. They also ensure that the project is delivered within the stated time and also quality is met.
Their roles are: development of project plans and timelines; risk management,  motivation of team members, and defining the scope and goals of the project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
